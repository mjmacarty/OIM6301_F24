# Welcome to OIM 6301 Python Materials Repository
All class demonstration files and problem set solutions will be found here.

### To get started install git on your computer to access files:
1. Visit [https://git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com)
2. Download and install the version for your operating system
3. Windows: Be sure to install "Use Git from Windows Command Prompt" 
4. Leave defaults selected for remaining install options
### To access files, go to [https://github.com/mjmacarty/OIM6301_F24](https://github.com/mjmacarty/OIM6301_F24). You will see our class files listed. You can open them in the browser by clicking on the file desired, but it is best to copy them to your own computer by following these steps:
1. Locate the green code button and click it
2. Copy the URL and search for and open git bash in Windows (terminal for MAC OS)
3. At the command prompt, type git clone and then paste the URL and hit enter (or copy nd paster the code from under step 4)
4. Alternatively you can directly enter at the command line:

    `git clone https://github.com/mjmacarty/OIM6301_F24.git`
5. The repository will be copied to your computer's home directory     

*This method creates a folder with the contents of the github repo in your computer's home directory. If you prefer that it be located elsewhere, you can change the location with the cd command, i.e. cd Documents will put the repository in your Documents folder.* 
### To update the folder on your computer:
1. Launch git bash (terminal in MAC OS)
2. Navigate to the repository on your computer
3. Enter:

    `git pull https:/github.com/mjmacarty/OIM6301_F24.git`
